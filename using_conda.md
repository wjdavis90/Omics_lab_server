# Using conda to install packages

The code below describes how to initialize the conda in /scratch/Tools so that a user can use it. It can be copied and paste into terminal/console to be run.

```bash
#Activate conda
source /scratch/Tools/anaconda3/bin/activate

#Next, initialize conda
conda init
```

Now, one will have to log out and log back in for the changes to take affect.
