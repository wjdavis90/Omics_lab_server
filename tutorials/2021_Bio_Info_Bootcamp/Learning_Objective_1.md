**The importance of taking good notes/properly annotating our scripts**

My first thought was to write out tutorials for the two bioinformatic pipelines that we will work through during boot camp. However, reviewing NAME's [first "Introduction to R" video](), I was reminded of the importance of properly documenting one's scripts. Just like it is important to keep a detailed labnotebook, it is important to take good notes on what you have done in the command line and to provide adequate annotation of what you did and what various lines in the scripts do. Thus, I decided that the best way to do that was to have us write the tutorial together as we document each step we take and why we took that step.

To post it on GitHub and to have it look pretty, we will need to use a variation of [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/).
