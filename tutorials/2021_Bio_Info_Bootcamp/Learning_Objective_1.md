**The importance of taking good notes/properly annotating our scripts**

My first thought was to write out tutorials for the two bioinformatic pipelines that we will work through during boot camp. However, reviewing NAME's [first "Introduction to R" video](), I was reminded of the importance of properly documenting one's scripts. Just like it is important to keep a detailed labnotebook, it is important to take good notes on what you have done in the command line and to provide adequate annotation of what you did and what various lines in the scripts do. Thus, I decided that the best way to do that was to have us write the tutorial together as we document each step we take and why we took that step.

To post it on GitHub and to have it look pretty, we will need to use a variation of [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/).

However, I feel that will be a bit too much to load onto all of you at once. If you wish to explore markdown and try to practice it at the boot camp, that is fine. For now, there are just two things that I want y'all to take away:

1. Document and explain everything. You should be able to return to your script 2 years from now and know what you did and why you did it.
2. To make a comment in a script, be it bash/shell or R, simply start the line with #. `#This is an example of a comment within a script. bash/shell/R will see the # and ignore everything after it.`
