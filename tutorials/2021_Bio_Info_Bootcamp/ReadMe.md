# Lamichhaney Lab Bioinformatic Boot Camp October 14-15 2021

## Learning Objectives

At the end of these two days, we will know:
1.	[the importance of taking good notes/properly annotating our scripts](https://github.com/wjdavis90/Omics_lab_server/blob/main/tutorials/2021_Bio_Info_Bootcamp/Learning_Objective_1.md)
2.	[how to navigate within an unix/unix-like system](https://github.com/wjdavis90/Omics_lab_server/blob/main/tutorials/2021_Bio_Info_Bootcamp/Unix_in_a_nutshell/navigating_unix.md)
3.	[how to create and manipulate files within an unix/unix-like system](https://github.com/wjdavis90/Omics_lab_server/blob/main/tutorials/2021_Bio_Info_Bootcamp/Unix_in_a_nutshell/create_manipulate_files.md)
4.	[how to download/install within an unix/unix-like system]()
5.	[how to set environmental variables and edit the bash profile within an unix/unix-like system](https://github.com/wjdavis90/Omics_lab_server/blob/main/tutorials/setting_PATH.md)
6.	[how to install packages and load libraries in R]()
7.	[how to import data into R]()
8.	[how to manipulate data in R]()
9.	[how to use ggplot2]()

## Pre-boot camp activities

Before boot camp begins, please:
1.	Install [R/RStudio](https://www.r-project.org/) on your local machine. Instructions for RStudio can be found [here](https://youtu.be/D6CunpqF04E).
2.	Install a suitable text editor on your local machine
     
     a.	NOT notepad, wordpad, or anything like Microsoft Windows
     
     b.	I use [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) for Windows
     
     c.	I used TextWrangler for mac, but it has been replaced with [BBEdit](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/)
     
     d.	There are other options if you don’t like either of those

3.	Create the following series of folders and subfolders somewhere
```bash
2021-BioInfo_Boot_Camp
     Data
        Day1
        Day2
     Tools
     Day1
     Day2
```
4.	Download the data from the Google Dive folder and place in the appropriate Data subfolder on your local machine
***DO NOT SHARE THE LINK OR THE DATA WITH ANYONE!*** It is data that we are currently working with on the Philornis project.
5. Review the documentation found in this folder and the appropriate subfolders.
